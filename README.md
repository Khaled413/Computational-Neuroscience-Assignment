This project implements a simple neural network in Python using the sigmoid activation function. The network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with sigmoid activation, and an output layer.

How It Works
The input values are processed through a hidden layer using the sigmoid activation function.
The output layer applies the sigmoid function to compute the final results.
Weights are randomly initialized within the range [-0.5, 0.5].
Fixed biases are used to influence neuron activation.
Code
The implementation is written in Python and utilizes NumPy for matrix operations. Check out the script for the complete implementation and debugging statements to track the computations.
