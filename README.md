# Neural Network Implementation

This project is a basic neural network implemented in Python using NumPy for efficient matrix operations. It takes two input values and processes them through a hidden layer to compute the final output using randomly initialized weights and biases.

## Features

- Implements a sigmoid activation function for both hidden and output layers.
- Randomly initializes weights within the range [-0.5, 0.5].
- Computes error based on predefined target values.
- Provides detailed logging for debugging and understanding the computation process.

## Code

The implementation is written in Python, leveraging NumPy for numerical operations. You can find the complete code in the `Neuroscience_project.py` file.
