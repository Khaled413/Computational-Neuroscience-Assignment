# Neural Network Implementation

This project implements a simple neural network with one hidden layer using Python and NumPy. The network processes two input values and computes output values using randomly initialized weights and biases.

## Features

- Uses a sigmoid activation function for both hidden and output layers.
- Initializes weights randomly in the range [-0.5, 0.5].
- Computes error based on target values.
- Includes detailed print statements for debugging and understanding each computation step.
